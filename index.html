     <p> My name is Fatemeh Ebrahimi. For now, I'm a Software Engineering student who is very interested in technology and everything related to the system.
     I'm the youngest member in my family although living so far from them. Basically, I grew up in Afghanistan and after finishing my high school and 
     passing Kankor examination, I entered to kabul Polytechnic University and started majoring in urban planning; but unfortunately due to the bad
      situation in my country I had to emigrate and continue my desired major in AUCA.</p>
