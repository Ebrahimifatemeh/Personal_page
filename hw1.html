<h2>Here's me, Fatemeh Ebrahimi</h2>


<P1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, My name is Fatemeh Ebrahimi and this is the first time that I
     am studying on campus mood at AUCA.</P1> 
<p2> Iâ€™m majoring in software Engineering and maybe That's why I am very
     interested in learning about different topics in my field and the world of technology. </p2>
     <br>    
</br>

<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up and studied my high school in Afghanistan, 
    and because of the problems and obstacles that existed there for girls and education,
     I was not able to take external classes regarding my field and interest. But beside these all, I always entertained myself with available resources or sites, and researched about my favorite programs which I really want to learn. In most of my free time, I read books, sketch, and edit videos and photos of my sketches. While editing, I always think about the way some websites are prepared that how they make a person's job easier by giving information; but exactly how they made? Was my always question which now is solved by understanding about HTML and web design name. </p3>
<br>
</br>
<p4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I do not have too much background in HTML, I am looking to gain a better understanding of its process that how it works and how to have a high-functioning and beautiful website at the same time to use it to make other people's work easier.</paragraph>
